<p align="center">reZov is a fork of voZer - another Telegram bot written in Python3 that can help you write random text from a bot base (botbase.txt or [chatid].txt) that is updated with chat messages and that connects in the correct base mode between chats where the bot is located.</p>

<p align="center">At the moment, the bot is only available in Russian
language, but the test branch is preparing support for several languages. (delayed due to change to standardized version)</p>
